Assignment 3
By Can H. Tartanoglu

1) FDs
    født -> alderen
    stilling, fareT, hemmeligT, skummeltT -> lønn
    stilling, fareT -> skummeltT

2)
    a)
        A+ = AL
    b)
        {NKA}+ = NKAFGLPB
    c)
        NKA alone defines all attributes in the Utstyr table, so it is a candidate key. We also see that:

        FGL -> K    Where A -> L
        So:
            FGA -> K
        We also see that N must be candidate key because it is always on the left side, and not right. FGAN is a candidate keys

        Answer:
        NKA and FGAN

3)
    a)
        Normal form in a relational database is a stepwise rating noting the balance bewtween number of relationships and chance for anamolies in a schema.

        In IN2090, we don't learn about all normal forms, but only BCNF ⊆ 3NF ⊆ 2NF ⊆ 1NF:

        - 1NF means every attribute is atomic; atomic means that it cannot be broken into smaller components.
        - 2NF must meet 1NF's requirements; additionally, attributes that are not keys are not functionally dependent on a subset of a candidate key. Candidate keys are minimal super keys; super keys are attributes that uniquely identify a row.
        - 3NF must meet predescessors requirements; additionally, that every non-key attribute is only functionally dependent on candidate keys.
        - BCNF must meet predescessors requirements; additionally, every functional dependency is super key.
    b)
        agentId -> navn
        agentId -> født

        navn, født -> agentId

        navn -> initialer

        oppgragNavn -> varighet
        oppgragNavn -> lokasjon

        Usign the algorithm from the lecture:
            - agentId -> navn
                agentId is not a super key, navn is a key attribute -> 3NF
            - agentId -> født
                agentId is not a super key, født is a key attribute -> 3NF
            - navn, født -> agentId
                navn, født is not a super key, agentId is a key attribute -> 3NF
            - oppgragNavn -> varighet
                oppdragNavn is not a super key, varighet is not a key attribute, oppdragNavn is a key attribute -> 2NF
            - oppgragNavn -> lokasjon
                oppdragNavn is not a super key, lokasjon is not a key attribute, oppdragNavn is a key attribute -> 2NF


        AgenterPåOppdrag has the 2NF normal form

4)
    Compositions:
        A+ -> ABC
        {BC}+ -> ABC
        D+ -> DEF
        E+ -> EF

    Make sure every FD is BCNF:
        A -> BC: A is not a super key, not BCNF (BC a key attribute -> 3NF)
            S1(A+) -> S1(ABC), S2(A, R/A+) -> S2(ADEF)

        - Decompose FDs in S1:
            BC -> A: BC is not a super key, not BCNF; however A+ = {BC}+

        - Decompose FDs in S2:
            D -> E: D is not a super key, not BCNF (E is not a key attribute, D is a key attribute -> 2NF)
            S3(D+) -> S3(DEF), S4(D, S2/D+) -> S4(DA)

        - Decompose FDs in S3:
            E -> F: E is not a super key, not BCNF (F is not key attribute, neith is E -> 1NF)
            S5(E+) -> S5(EF), S6(E, S3/E+) -> S6(ED)

        All FDs have been decomposed

    Lossless decomposition:
        R -> S1 ⋈ S4 ⋈ S5 ⋈ S6
